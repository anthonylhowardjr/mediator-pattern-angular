# Mediator Pattern in Angular 17 with Primitive Signals

## Introduction

This project aims to explore the effectiveness of the mediator pattern in Angular 17 using primitive signals. The mediator pattern facilitates communication between components in an organized manner, promoting loose coupling and simplifying component interactions.

## Objectives

* Implement the mediator pattern utilizing Angular's primitive signals.
* Analyze the impact of the mediator pattern on component communication and code maintainability.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of the mediator pattern in real-world Angular applications.

## Expected Outcomes

* Enhanced code reusability and maintainability by decoupling components and centralizing communication.
* Improved component collaboration and data flow management.
* Clearer separation of concerns and responsibilities among components.

## Project Scope

* Develop a demonstration application showcasing the mediator pattern in Angular 17.
* Conduct performance and maintainability tests to assess the pattern's impact.
* Document the findings and recommendations for adopting the mediator pattern in Angular projects.
